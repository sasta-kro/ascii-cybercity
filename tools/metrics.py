"""Measure a CyberCity CCFRAME dump: exposure and colour-energy split.

A cell is classified by what it ACTUALLY prints — max(r,g,b) scaled by lum — not by lum
alone, because lum lies: P.shadow at lum 255 is still only (40,50,66) while P.pure at lum
40 is (40,40,40). "black" therefore means a cell no eye would call lit.

Reads CCFRAME 1 (glyph,colour,lum) and CCFRAME 2 (glyph,colour,lum,KIND) alike. The v2
kind byte was added when the harness started dumping it and this file was not updated, so
it unpacked three fields from a four-field cell and died with a ValueError on every dump
the current tools/headless.cjs writes. Two agents worked around it with throwaway scripts
rather than fixing it; the fix is the two lines below and a kind breakdown for free.
