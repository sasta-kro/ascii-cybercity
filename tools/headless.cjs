/* THE REPLAY. One outer loop over ticks: camera, then every element's update(), then the frame is
 * DRAWN — the exact shape of main.js's tick(), which calls step() and then render() every time
 * round. Element updates must see the camera pose of THEIR OWN tick, not the final one.
 *
 * WHY THE WARM-UP DRAWS ARE NOT WASTE, which is the bug this loop was rewritten to fix. Three
 * passes in src/elements/optics.js measure the FRAME inside draw() and integrate that measurement
 * inside update(): the exposure pass's two lagged luminance filters, the light-shaft detector, and
 * the light-wash detector. Their update() opens by returning if no frame has been measured yet, so
 * a replay that called update() 9000 times and draw() once left all three sitting at exactly their
 * cold-start values — exposure's adaptation pinned at 1.000 with its filters never seeded, the
 * shafts landing on a first detection with no easing history behind them, and the wash's lean term
 * (which IS the eased position's lag, so it can only exist once easing has run) at a flat zero, so
 * no offline frame ever rendered has shown the wedge leaning. Every palette share, black
 * percentage and luminance histogram this project has published was therefore measured on a frame
 * the browser only draws once, at start-up.
 *
 * The audit behind that list was run over all 38 elements by proxying every element object and
 * recording which fields are written in draw() and read in update(); those three are the whole
 * set. (pedestrians also refreshes this.cols/rows/cells in draw(), but init() is handed the same
 * dims by this harness, so it reads the right numbers from its first tick and has no hole.)
 *
 * WHAT IT COST THE OLD NUMBERS, measured cold against warm over seeds 5,10,...,150 (thirty seeds,
 * an arithmetic list, not four hand-picked ones) at 400x100. POOLED, almost nothing: at frame 600
 * the lit-energy pillars move amber 38.62% -> 38.55% and azure 33.90% -> 33.97%, black 60.58% ->
 * 60.66%. PER SEED, quite a lot: the exposure gain at frame 600 runs from 0.897 (seed 150) to
 * 1.060 (seed 80) where the old harness reported exactly 1.000 for every seed, and half the seeds
 * are more than 2% off it. That moves one frame's census by up to 1.8 points of black, 1.1 points
 * of hot tail and 2.3 of mean printed value at frame 600, and up to 3.8 / 1.6 / 3.1 at frame 3000.
 * So: a pooled palette share fitted the old way is still good, and any threshold fitted to a
 * SINGLE frame was fitted to that frame's adaptation as much as to the print curve.
 *
 * The cost is honest and it is the raycast's: a warm tick is a full 400x100 render, about 8 ms, of
 * which 5.8 ms is CC.Cast.render. --cold skips the warm-up and restores the old behaviour for the
 * cases where only the seed's geometry matters and the wait does not pay — it is NOT the frame the
 * browser draws, and it says so on stderr. Sweeps are per-seed independent, so the wait is a
 * `seq ... | xargs -P 8` away from being eight times shorter. */
