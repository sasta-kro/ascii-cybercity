/* CyberCity optics — the glass between the city and the eye.
 *
 * Nothing in this file belongs to the city. It is the last thing that happens to a frame: light
 * hanging in the rain under a strong source, the wash a close lamp throws across the wall behind
 * it, the far end of the street going cold in mist, the fall-off at the edge of vision, fogged
 * glass, drops beaded on the lens, the flare off the hottest cells, the faint horizontal texture
 * of the display, and the eye adapting to all of it.
 *
 * THE BUDGET, which is the whole discipline of this file. The frame is 40-55% pure black and that
 * IS the look. So of the seven passes here, three cannot add a single lit cell by construction —
 * they only multiply cells the city already drew — and of the four that can write a glyph, three
 * write into black air alone and the fourth is rationed to twenty sources.
 *
 * SEVEN, not the nine this file was written with. Nothing was cut: the two edge-weighted
 * multipliers (vignette, condensation) are one pass and the two whole-frame multipliers
 * (scanlines, exposure) are another, because each pair was walking the same cells to apply what
 * is arithmetically a single number. See sections 4 and 8.
 *
 * The whole file, measured against the version that shipped before it, over seeds 3/7/42/99 at
 * frames 600/3000/9000 at 400x100 (exposure held out of both sides, because its free-running sine
 * is at a different phase in the two builds and would swamp the comparison): lit coverage
 * 59.43% -> 59.57%, +0.14 points, and mean printed luminance +0.31%. It is not evenly spread and
 * it is not meant to be — mist gains +0.48 points of coverage and LOSES 0.13% of its luminance,
 * because the shafts open up and the condensation takes more contrast off than they add; drizzle
 * loses 0.02 points and 0.61%; a downpour gains 1.27% of luminance almost entirely from the wash
 * off the near signage. Re-measure exactly this way before touching any constant below.
 *
 * MOST OF THESE PASSES MODULATE cells they did not create. put() only accepts a strictly nearer
 * depth, so see nearer() for how that rewrite is bought without opening a hole in the depth
 * buffer that a later element could fall through.

   * wedge of light across the facade behind it, and the wedge arrives before the lamp does and
   * leaves after it. The cars themselves belong to street.js and this file may not touch them, so

   * bright near thing qualifies: a headlamp, a shopfront two metres away, a blade sign at the
   * corner. That is not a compromise, it is the honest generalisation.
   *
   * This pass is PURE GAIN. It never writes a glyph, so it cannot cost a single cell of coverage
   * and cannot recolour anything; all it does is decide that some cells the city already drew are
   * standing in somebody's light. The wedge leans in the direction the source is travelling,
   * which costs nothing to know: the eased position lags the detected one, and that lag IS the
   * screen velocity.

   * 4. The fall-off at the edge of vision, and the glass fogging over it.
   *
   * TWO EFFECTS, ONE WALK, and the fusion is the point rather than a micro-optimisation.
   *
   * The vignette is corner fall-off. Its map is a pure function of the viewport, so it is built
   * once per size and then read. The shape is deliberately weak at the mid-edges (~3%) and only
   * real in the corners (~32%): a vignette strong enough to see as a ring reads as a lens fault,
   * whereas this one just keeps the eye off the four places where the raycaster's frustum is
   * least honest.
   *
   * The condensation is the glass itself fogging, and only in real fog — the one term in this
   * file that is pure subtraction. Mist does not put light on a lens, it takes contrast off one,
   * in slow soft patches that sit still while the city moves behind them. The pattern is
   * therefore built ONCE per viewport and never re-rolled: condensation that crawls is a
   * screensaver, condensation that sits there is a window. It is weighted to the edges of the
   * frame because that is where a real one survives — the middle of any glass anybody is looking
   * through gets wiped, by a hand, a blower or the heat of whatever is behind it.
   *
   * WHY THEY ARE ONE PASS. They are both edge-weighted scalar multipliers over the whole frame
   * with nothing between them in the layer order, so run separately they cost two full-frame
   * traversals and two read-modify-writes of the same cell to apply what is arithmetically one
   * number. Measured over the canonical sweep, condensation on its own reached 12-17% of the
   * frame at mean |dV| 3.5-5.2 — real, but the same shape and the same order of magnitude as the
   * vignette that had just walked the identical cells. Folding the fog term into the vignette's
   * own multiplier keeps the weather (the patches are still there, still only in mist) and pays
   * for it once. The condensation map stays lazily allocated: most weather never asks for it, and
   * a cols*rows Float32Array for a term that is switched off is a page per viewport spent on
   * nothing.

   * 6. Rain beading on the lens.

   * something lit — which is precisely when a real one does. Over black it leaves the faintest
   * catch-light, and that is all.
   *
   * Positions are normalised, so a resize moves the drops with the frame instead of stranding
   * them off-screen or forcing a reallocation.
   *
   * HOW MANY there are is the weather's business, and the count is a RATCHET, not a mirror of
   * P.rain: glass that has been rained on stays rained on. It fills fast when it starts (12 s)
   * and clears at the speed water actually leaves a vertical surface (a minute and a half), which
   * is why a drizzle that follows a downpour still looks like the downpour just ended. The

   * 7. Lens bloom — the halo, and the streak off the very hottest cells.

   * Two things a real lens does with a light it cannot quite contain, and they are two ends of
   * one mechanism, so they are one pass:
   *
   *   the HALO is scatter inside the glass, it is a gain on the cells immediately around a source
   *   and therefore costs no coverage at all, and it grows with haze because haze is what puts
   *   the scattering medium in front of the lens in the first place;
   *
   *   the STREAK is the anamorphic one — a horizontal flare off the brightest handful of cells
   *   only. It is the single loudest thing in this file, so it is rationed to eight sources that
   *   have to be local peaks, it writes only into cells nothing else wanted, and it leans with
   *   the pan: the smear on wet glass runs the way the world is sliding, which is the way the
   *   camera is turning.
   *
   * Both are anchored to lum >= 175 BEFORE the print curve, which is where the sources actually
   * are: signage, headlamps, the hot core of a shopfront. At eight sources the halo was a private
   * joke — 56 cells in a 400x100 frame, which is not a property of the lens, it is a coincidence.
   * Twenty is enough for the frame to read as being seen THROUGH something and still small enough
   * that the streaks stay countable.

   * 8. The display, and the eye in front of it — scanlines and exposure in one walk.
   *
   * THE SCANLINES are two terms. A fixed every-other-row dip, which is the display itself and
   * never moves, and one very broad bar rolling once every ~25 seconds at a third of that depth.
   * The bar is the part that is easy to overdo: at 2.6% it is invisible as an object and only
   * registers as the frame being faintly alive.
   *
   * WHY THE TWO ARE ONE PASS. The scanline factor is per-ROW and the exposure factor is per-FRAME,
   * so their product is per-row too, and nothing in the build draws between layer 96 and layer 98.
   * Kept apart they walked the whole frame twice and read-modify-wrote every cell twice to apply
   * one number per row. Multiplied together first, the row factor is computed once for the row and
   * the frame is touched once. ANYONE ADDING AN ELEMENT AT LAYER 97 has to split them again, which
   * is the one thing this fusion assumes.
   *
   * The exposure measurement now happens BEFORE the scanline dip is applied rather than after it,
   * which is the only behavioural difference and it cancels: the adaptation below is a RATIO of two
   * lagged copies of that measurement, so a near-constant ~1.5% scale on both terms divides out.
   *
   * THE BREATHE is unchanged in shape: two incommensurate sines so the loop never closes audibly.
   * It is the one effect meant to be felt and never seen, and its amplitude is down a third to
   * make room for the term below without the two of them ever summing past the +-4.6% the frame
   * was built to tolerate.
   *
   * THE ADAPTATION is new and it is a response, not an oscillation. It measures the frame's own
   * energy and keeps two lagged copies of it: a FAST one, which is roughly the retina, and a SLOW
   * one, which is the adapted state the retina is being compared against. The printed gain is the
   * ratio of the two. Stand still and they converge, the ratio is 1 and the pass does nothing at
   * all. Walk out of a dark block into a lit parade and the fast term jumps while the slow one is
   * still in the dark, so the frame is pulled DOWN for a second or two and then released as the
   * eye catches up — which is what walking into a bright street actually feels like. Walking into
   * the dark does the same in reverse, and more slowly, because dark adaptation is slower than
   * light adaptation in the eye as well.
   *
   * WHY IT CANNOT PUMP. The fast term's time constant is half a second, which is four times the
   * length of the longest lightning stroke in weather.js, so the biggest transient this city can
   * produce moves it by a few percent. The exponent is a fractional power, so even a doubling of
   * scene energy asks for well under a stop. And the whole thing is clamped: nothing this pass
   * does can move the frame by more than the CLAMP below, ever.
   *
   * WHERE IT IS MEASURED. In draw(), because that is the only place the frame exists — and then
   * integrated in update(), on the fixed tick, so the adaptation takes the same time in seconds
   * whatever the panel is doing. That is one tick of lag on a quantity whose own time constant is
   * half a second. The very first draw seeds BOTH filters from the same measurement, so the frame
   * the viewer opens on is the fully-adapted one and the piece never fades up out of a start-up
   * transient; everything after it is history.
   *
   * KNOWN-BUG NOTE. This element is not the source of the reduced-motion breathing report. Before
   * this rewrite it returned on its first line under CC.reducedMotion and contributed nothing at
   * all; measured over 5 s of wall clock at three seeds, the frame's mean-luminance sigma was
   * 20.7%/21.4%/8.9% in normal motion against 6.1%/1.7%/2.9% under reduced motion, i.e. the frame
   * already breathed far LESS with reduced motion on. It still does: the sines stay off there and
   * the adaptation, which is a stabiliser, is the only term left.
   *
   * HOW TO MEASURE THIS PASS, because the obvious way reports zero and a review has already been
   * misled by it. The measurement this element integrates can only be taken in draw(), so a
   * harness that replays update() and calls draw() once leaves this.meas at -1 for the entire
   * replay, update() returning on its first line and `adapt` pinned at exactly 1. That is what
   * tools/headless.cjs used to do, and it is why every palette share and every luminance
   * histogram this project published before the harness was fixed was taken with this pass
   * switched off; the fix was to draw every tick, not to touch anything here, because measuring
   * in draw and integrating on the fixed tick is what main.js actually does. A still-frame census
   * run the old way measures the breathe alone: mean |dV| 1.0-1.9 over the canonical sweep,
   * nothing moving by 10, which reads as a pass that does nothing. Replayed the way main.js runs
   * it, `adapt` sits between 0.93 and 1.10 at 400x100 and swings 6.9%/8.7%/15.1% over four
   * seconds on seeds 42/3/99, reaching its clamp. At seed 42 frame 3180 that is the whole frame's
   * printed mean moving 2.9% with no single cell moving by 10, which is exactly the signature of
   * an exposure change and exactly what a per-cell threshold cannot see: you cannot detect a fade
   * by asking whether any one cell jumped.
   *
   * AND WHAT THAT COSTS THE READER OF A SINGLE OFFLINE FRAME. `adapt` is a full-frame multiplier
   * with a history, so the frame at (seed, tick) now carries whatever gain the walk up to that
   * tick earned — near 1.00 on a steady block, down at the 0.88 clamp a second after stepping out
   * into a lit parade. Two frames of the same seed a few hundred ticks apart are no longer at the
   * same exposure, and a threshold census (black%, hot%) will move by more than the geometry did.
   * That is the honest picture and not a defect, but anything fitting a curve to a single frame
   * has to know it is fitting to that frame's adaptation as well.
