/* CyberCity weather — the visible face of CC.Weather.
 *
 * Five elements, one file, because they all read the same wind vector, the same projection helper
 * and the same weather block, and splitting them would mean five copies of all three.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WHEN CC.Weather LANDED. Every constant in here used to be tuned for one unchanging
 * sky. They are now functions of the live weather block, and the scaling rule is the one
 * weather_state.js states: an element multiplies its EXISTING tuned constant by the parameter
 * divided by that parameter's value in the `rain` preset — the preset the whole build was tuned
 * under — so the scale is 1.0 under `rain` and the file reproduces exactly what it printed before.
 * Multiplying by the raw 0..1 parameter instead would silently re-tune the whole file to 65% of
 * itself. Those reference values are the REF_* constants below; dividing by them here rather than
 * calling CC.Weather.rel() is the same arithmetic without an Array#indexOf per call, and it also
 * means this file still runs when weather_state.js is not loaded at all — which is exactly the
 * case in tools/lightning-rate.cjs, whose whole job is to measure the envelope under the reference
 * sky.
 *
 * PROJECTION. The raycaster's camera is planar, not cylindrical, and these elements must agree
 * with it EXACTLY or a raindrop lands one column off the wall it is supposed to be in front of.
 * The forward axis distance w comes from a plain dot product, the column falls out of r/w, and
 * the row uses the same `horizon - (y-eyeY)*scale/w` the wall tops use. `scale` is re-derived the
 * way raycast.js derives it — from fov and the cell aspect — because cam.scaleY is optional and
 * the harness sets a `cam.scale` that raycast.js deliberately ignores. Nothing here hardcodes the
 * horizon or the fov: the camera pitches and zooms, and a hardcoded rows*0.56 tears the rain away
 * from the city the moment somebody looks up.
 *
 * DEPTH. Every write goes through CC.put with the point's RADIAL distance sqrt(w^2+r^2), which is
 * the same quantity raycast.js stores in frame.dist (w*len). That is what makes rain fall in
 * front of the near facade and vanish behind the far one instead of raining through the city.
 *
 * BUDGET. Weather is allowed about a point and a half of lit coverage under the `rain` preset and
 * more under a downpour — a downpour that costs the same as a drizzle is not a downpour. Measured
 * at 200x60 against the same frame with these five elements' draw suppressed, seeds 3, 42 and 99
 * at frame 3000, in points of lit cells and in share of cells touched:
 *
 *     clear    +0.09 / +0.25 / +0.15     0.5-1.0% of cells touched
 *     drizzle  +0.54 / +0.52 / +0.40     0.8-1.5%
 *     rain     +1.15 / +1.17 / +1.12     2.0-2.7%      <- the reference sky
 *     downpour +1.79 / +2.06 / +2.14     5.3-7.3%
 *     mist     +0.85 / -0.85 / +0.64    28-45%
 *     storm    +1.41 / +1.18 / +1.75     4.1-5.3%
 *
 * Clear is steam and residual ledge drip and nothing else — the director keeps P.steam at 0.55 on
 * a dry night. Mist touches half the frame and can still come out NEGATIVE on lit coverage,
 * because the veil takes more of the city away than the bank puts back; that is the whole point of
 * it. A lightning peak is worth about +14 on top of any of those and lasts a fifth of a second.
 * The frame is 40-55% pure black and that is the look; every threshold below was pulled down until
 * that held.
 *
 * SAFETY. The lightning envelope at the bottom of this file is the one thing in the project that
 * can physically harm a viewer. It is measured, not tuned by eye, and `node tools/lightning-rate.cjs`
 * is the measurement. Read the block above lgEnv before touching any constant near it.

   * EXPORTED, because it is not only this file's business: banners, cables, litter, awnings and

   *     dirX, dirZ  unit direction the wind blows TOWARD, constant for the life of a city.
   *     base        mean speed in m/s for the current weather, gust excluded.
   *     speed       |(x,z)|, i.e. base*mult, which is what a travel rate wants.
   *     gust        the live wind STRENGTH on the director's own 0..1 scale: P.wind beaten by the
   *                 gust envelope. This is the number to scale a swing, a lean or a flutter by —
   *                 0.55 under the reference sky, near nothing on a still night, up to about 1.6
   *                 on the hardest gust of a storm. structure.js's banners and lanterns read
   *                 exactly this field and fall back to `P.wind * (0.70 + 0.66*noise)` without it,
   *                 which is the same quantity and the same range; keep it that way.
   *     mult        the raw gust multiplier on `base`, mean 1 by construction. Only wanted if you
   *                 are computing a speed rather than a magnitude.
   *
   * It is refreshed once per t by syncWeather() below, from whichever element runs first; every
   * reader in the same frame therefore sees the same vector.
   *
   * The init guard is keyed on the CITY OBJECT, never on a boolean. A `if (windSet) return` latch
   * does the right thing for the elements of one init round and the wrong thing forever after: a
   * #hashchange rebuilds the world and calls init() again with a fresh rng, and a latched wind
   * meant the new city kept the previous one's weather. Comparing the city identity keeps the

   *
   * Everything about it now tracks the sky: the population, the fall speed, the streak length,
   * the near/far balance, the slant (through the gusting wind), whether the drops are water or
   * sleet, whether they splash, and whether the ledges are still dripping after it stopped.
   * At P.rain 0 the whole element returns before it draws a single cell — a thin rain under a
   * clear sky was the single most obviously wrong thing in the build before the director existed.
   * ==========================================================================================*/
  /* The array is allocated once at the maximum and only a PREFIX of it is walked, because the

   * population that reads as rain at 200x60 disappears at 400x100. The shells are interleaved for
   * exactly this reason — any prefix has to be a valid mix of near and far, and a near-then-far
   * layout would have made the small-window case pure near shell.

   * RN_MAX IS A CAPACITY AND NOTHING ELSE — see fork() above for why that sentence needs saying.
   * It is sized so the cap never bites at any size the project renders at, because a cap that
   * bites is a cap that flattens the difference between rain and a downpour, which is the one
   * difference this file exists to draw. The largest request the presets can make is a downpour
   * (P.rain 1.00, so dens 1.5385 and dens^1.55 1.9497) at the canonical verification size of
   * 400x100: 640 * 1.9497 * 40000/12000 = 4159 drops. At 2800 that request was clamped by a third,
   * and the cap is not a neutral one — it flattened the two heaviest skies into each other. Drawn
   * drops per frame at 400x100, seeds 3/42/99: downpour 947/925/1038 against storm 931/905/997,
   * a ratio of 1.03, where at 200x60 (which neither sky clamps at) the same measurement gives
   * 1.36. Uncapped, 400x100 comes back at 1.32 and agrees with the smaller frame again. Every
   * offline comparison of downpour with storm at the size this project verifies at was reading
   * the cap. The browser never comes near it (main.js caps columns at MAXC and a 4K display gives
   * ~20500 cells, where a downpour asks for 640*1.9497*1.708 = 2131), so this headroom is bought

         * the piece's heaviest sky switches itself off depends on the seed. At 0.24 a band is
         * 4.2 m, so three sit across the near shell and eight across the far one, and a gust

   * 3.7% of peak on every stroke at every storm level, the attack keeps all of its frames, and the

   * 5.4, 28.9, 26.3, 24.0, 6.6 added lum per cell — bright/dark/bright/dark with its two maxima
   * 0.100 s apart, 10 Hz instantaneous against a 3 Hz ceiling, and one 16 ms frame dropping
   * 47.7 -> 6.6, the entire amplitude of the flash in a single frame across the whole viewport.
   * Every one of those edges came from the ternaries: a constant multiplier that changes value at
   * a threshold IS a step, however smooth the exponential it multiplies.
   *
   * What replaced it is one continuous function with a bounded derivative everywhere.
   *   - cos(u*LG_W) rides on a 0.55 floor, so the trough between the returns dims rather than
   *     extinguishes and the eye reads a pulse instead of a blink;
   *   - max(0, cos) flattens the negative lobe into a plateau rather than inverting it into a
   *     third peak, which is what keeps the count at exactly two maxima;
   *   - LG_W = 6.8 puts the second return 0.924 s after the first in the raw cosine; the decay
   *     drags it forward and the onset ramp pushes the first back, and the MEASURED gap is
   *     0.667 s = 1.50 Hz, half the ceiling, with the second return at 14% of the first;
   *   - the 0.15 s raised-cosine attack replaces an onset that stepped 0 -> full amplitude in one
   *     frame. It brings the largest single-frame change down from 100% of peak to 20.9%;
   *   - LG_FADE does the same job at the other end, because a hard cutoff at LG_DUR is a step
   *     edge too, just a dimmer one.
   *
   * NOTHING IN THIS FUNCTION IS ALLOWED TO DEPEND ON THE WEATHER. The storm parameter moves how
   * OFTEN a stroke fires and how BRIGHT it is, never the shape or the timing of one, because the
   * shape and the timing are the only things the safety measurement can check. A storm that also
   * shortened LG_DUR or widened LG_W would be a different envelope on every frame and the
   * regression test would be measuring a sky nobody ever sees.
   *
   * The strike windows are the outer guarantee, and they got TIGHTER rather than looser when the
   * storm gained a rate: the window is 5.5 s and the start jitter runs from LG_JIT to LG_PER-1.2,
   * so two strokes from adjacent windows can be no closer than LG_JIT + 1.2 = 1.7 s — half a
   * second further apart than the 1.2 s the old 16 s window allowed. update() takes the MAXIMUM of
   * the overlapping windows and never their sum, so two strokes cannot add into a brighter one,
   * and the maxima of a maximum are the maxima of its arguments: overlapping strokes cannot
