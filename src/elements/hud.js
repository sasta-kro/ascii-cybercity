/* CyberCity hint overlay — the only text in the piece, and it is made of city.
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN ELEMENT AND NOT A DIV. A caption in HTML would sit on a sheet of glass in front of
 * the artwork: no fog, no bloom, no scanline, no vignette, wrong colour space, wrong font, and
 * crisp in a frame where nothing else is. Drawn through CC.put at layer 90 it is instead IN the
 * picture — optics.js vignettes it in the corner, the scanline rolls over it, the exposure breathe
 * lifts it with everything else, and CC.tone prints it through the same curve as a streetlight. It
 * reads as a readout stencilled on the inside of a visor, which is the only kind of UI a piece
 * like this can have.
 *
 * THE FONT IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM. CC.GLYPHS is 49 characters chosen for TEXTURE — the letters in it
 * are the ones that make good façade noise (A H K M N O Q U V W X Y Z) and no others. There is no
 * S, no D, no E, no R, no T, no I, no L. So not one of the six weather names is spellable, "MOVE"
 * is not spellable, and neither is any key label worth printing; and core.js is not this file's to
 * extend. The way out is that a glyph does not have to BE the letter — it can be a pixel of one.
 * Every character below is a 3x5 bitmap stamped one CC.GLYPHS cell per lit pixel, which is exactly
 * how the blade signs on the buildings are already made, one row up in the same frame. It costs
 * four columns per character, which is why every string here is terse to the point of rudeness and
 * why the whole overlay disappears rather than wrap on a grid too narrow to hold it.
 *
 * IT IS PURE. The envelope is CC.Control.hintAlpha(t), a stamped function of the simulation clock
 * rather than an accumulator, so tools/headless.cjs renders the overlay at frame 30 exactly as the
 * browser draws it at frame 30 and the thing can be tuned by looking at it offline like everything
 * else. The only impurity is H, which restamps the envelope — the same deal weather_state.js makes
 * for its preset keys.

   * TWO depths, and the gap between them is what makes the overlay readable at all. The bottom of

   * white '8' at high lum — and the first version of this file put dim slate letters straight on
   * top of it, where they were simply invisible: every glyph was present in the buffer and the
   * eye could not find a single one of them. So each character first BLANKS its own box (see
   * plate()) and then draws into it. The blanks go at PLATE_D and the letters at the nearer
   * HUD_D, which means a blank can never erase a letter that has already been drawn — CC.put's
   * own depth test refuses it — and the clearing can therefore be interleaved with the drawing in
