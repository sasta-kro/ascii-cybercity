/* CyberCity signage — everything the street lights itself with.
 *
 * Four ambient systems, four ELEMENTS entries: shop-window spill on the pavement, neon mounted on
 * facades, traffic signals at the junctions, holographic adverts hung mid-canyon.
 *
 * Placement is NOT a spawn list. The walk is endless, so every fixture is a pure function of the
 * world cell (or of the street-lattice index) it hangs on: nothing is allocated, nothing is
 * recycled, and scrubbing time backwards puts every sign back exactly where it was. The cost of
 * that is a bounded scan of the cells around the camera each frame, which is why every scan below
 * rejects on the cheap forward-distance dot product before it touches a hash or the heightmap.
 *
 * THE VOCABULARY. `neon` used to have two shapes — a stack of characters down a corner and a row
 * of them over a door — which is not a city, it is a texture applied to one. It now has twelve
 * STYLES, each with its own construction, its own animation and its own way of failing, chosen per
 * lot by a weighted roll off the district so a concrete quarter is full of half-dead boards and the
 * arcade strip is full of chase borders and character blocks. They are listed at S_TUBE below.
 * The one that carries the most weight in the references is S_BLOCK, the stacked square clusters
 * that read as a language: it is the difference between "signs" and "this city has writing on it".
 *
 * HOW BIG A SIGN ACTUALLY IS, which is the thing that decides whether any of that vocabulary
 * reaches the viewer. Instrumented over the canonical sweep (seeds 3/7/42/99 x frames
 * 600/3000/9000/18000 at 400x100, through the real harness — the frame checksum of the
 * instrumented render matches tools/headless.cjs cell for cell): 125 fixtures land, 7.8 a frame,
 * 281 cells a frame, 0.70% of the picture. The MEDIAN fixture is 3.1 screen columns wide at 30 m
 * and 72% of them are under 8 columns. All twelve styles appear, and most of them had nowhere to
 * happen, in two separate ways that were both being blamed on the constructions:
 *
 *   1. THE GRID WAS FINER THAN THE SCREEN. A fixture's character grid is fixed in the world at up
 *      to 9 columns, and the shader is point-sampled once per screen column, so at 3 columns two
 *      grid columns in three are never asked about — 52% of all fixtures had a grid at least twice
 *      as fine as their own footprint. Which columns survived was a function of where the board's
 *      edge fell between two cells, so a hollow tube printed as an L, a chase border lost a side,
 *      and a character block lost the gaps that made it characters. board() now coarsens the drawn
 *      grid to what the screen can sample (52% -> 11% undersampled) while shade() keeps every
 *      letterform, brightness jitter and screen-noise lookup indexed in the WORLD grid, so the
 *      construction gets coarser on approach and the writing does not reshuffle.
 *   2. BELOW A CERTAIN SIZE THERE IS NO CONSTRUCTION, only its ink — four or five loose marks in
 *      the two pillar hues, drawn from the same glyph bank the window lattice behind them is drawn
 *      from, at the wall's own brightness. So under MIN_C x MIN_R a fixture crossfades into its own
 *      MASS: the case fills the cells the construction leaves dark and everything converges on one
 *      level, which is what a real sign reduces to at distance and the one property shared by every
 *      style the craft review found legible. Measured on the printed frame as the largest connected
 *      run of the fixture's own cells at v>=60: median 10 -> 12 cells, mean 15.7 -> 18.5, and the
 *      styles that read worst gained most (chase 8 -> 16, screen 4 -> 10, block 8 -> 13, tube
 *      11 -> 13.5) while the ones that already read are untouched by construction (marquee 9 -> 10).
 *      The crossfade is over two cells of span rather than a threshold, because the quantity it
 *      keys on is one the walk changes continuously; and since the mass level is a constant, the
 *      blend can only REDUCE a cell's temporal amplitude — measured, tools/flicker-rate.cjs returns
 *      exactly the same worst per-cell step for `neon` before and after, 15.3/13.3/17.3/19.6% on
 *      seeds 0/7/42/555, on 15% more painted cells.
 *
 * The bill for both: 281 -> 337 cells a frame, 0.70% -> 0.84% of the picture, almost all of it
 * dark case rather than light. Over the same 16 frames the printed palette does not move — amber
 * 22.59% -> 22.58% of lit energy, azure 24.91% -> 24.88%, black 44.02% -> 43.98%.
 *
 * WHAT A SIGN LIGHTS. A sign is a light source, and until this pass it lit nothing — it was a
 * bright decal on a wall that stayed exactly as dark as the wall next door. Every fixture now
 * casts (castGlow), and the cast is deliberately a MODULATION of cells that are already painted
 * rather than new marks: the wall it is bolted to, the pavement under it, the awning over the
 * stall in front, the rain falling through it and the near edge of whoever is walking past all
 * arrive in the frame before layer 30 does, so lighting them costs energy and almost no coverage.
 * That is the whole trick, and it is why the budget below barely moved for the largest visible
 * change in the file.
 *
 * WET REFLECTION. As the road wets, every fixture smears down it toward the viewer (wetSmear) at
 * the fixture's own screen column, in the fixture's own colour. surfaces.js owns the road's general
 * wetness and its anonymous streaking; this owns the reflection OF A NAMED SIGN, which is the one
 * thing a generic road texture cannot know about.
 *
 * PHOTOSENSITIVITY IS A CEILING, NOT A PREFERENCE. Nothing here flashes above 3 Hz and no cell may
 * move more than a third of full scale in one frame. Every travelling crest in this file is a
 * smoothstep PLATEAU rather than a threshold, for the reason spelled out at the holo scan band; the
 * one deliberate strobe (S_FAIL) is a 2.2 Hz sine of amplitude 0.28, whose worst frame is 6.4% of
 * full scale; the ticker changes GLYPH and not luminance, so its 2 Hz step is a shape change and
 * not a luminance edge at all.
 *
 * tools/flicker-rate.cjs is the judge and it says PASS, but read what it actually covers: part 1
 * lifts flick() out of this file, and part 2 drives the real elements over four seeds and eight
 * bearings. Neither one knows the styles exist. So each style was ALSO forced city-wide on its own
 * and measured — worst per-cell frame step, and the strongest 3-20 Hz component of the forty
 * busiest cells over 24 s, Hann windowed exactly the way the tool does it:
 *
 *   tube 23.1%/1.47%   blade 23.9%/1.45%   chase 17.6%/0.29%   wipe 25.1%/1.45%
 *   ticker 0.0%/0.00%  block 22.7%/1.46%   flap 2.7%/0.32%     fail 3.1%/0.04%
 *   backlit 0.0%/0.00% arrow 3.9%/0.28%    screen 1.2%/0.03%   marquee 27.5%/1.78%
 *
 * Every one is inside the 34% step and 2% band limits. The 3.79 Hz line the lit styles all carry is
 * flick()'s failing starter and nothing else — it is the same line part 1 reports at 1.06% on the
 * multiplier. Three of those numbers are the record of a bug this pass introduced and fixed, and
 * the fixes are written up where they live: the visibility cut in board(), the smear gate under it,
 * and the screen's black level. Compared like for like against the file this replaced, on the same
 * measurement: worst per-cell step 18.8% against 26.3%, strongest 3-20 Hz 1.14% against 1.75%.
 *
 * Coverage budget, measured by rendering seeds 3/7/42/99 at frames 600/3000/9000 at 400x100 with
 * the four elements drawn and again with them skipped — the same process and the same rng draw
 * either way, or the elements downstream re-roll and a third of the frame changes for reasons that
 * have nothing to do with signage: signage owns 1.74% of cells (the file it replaces: 1.05%) and
 * adds 0.29 points of lit coverage (0.33). It touches two thirds again as many cells for LESS new
 * light, which is the cast doing exactly what it was built to do. Lit energy over those twelve
 * frames with signage in: amber 27.4%, azure 24.0% against 27.6%/23.7% without it — the two pillars
 * level and unmoved — ember 2.0%, spring 0.7%, violet under 0.05%. That is the whole point: the
 * references are 54-60% pure black and signage is the one thing in frame allowed to be truly
 * bright, so it has to stay small or it stops reading as bright at all.

       * move it, so the mean multiplier is 0.832 against the old 0.828: over 64 frames across four

           * worst step collapses to 1.6-3.1%, which is the scan band and nothing else — so the bob
           * was the whole of it. It PASSES the tool, because 0.25 Hz is nowhere near the 3 Hz
           * photosensitivity ceiling; it was the largest single-cell discontinuity in the build
           * anyway, and no statistic in the repo could see it because it is one cell wide.
           *
           * Neither of the other two obvious fixes works. Quantising the bob to whole cells makes
           * the teleport rarer and not smaller — it is still a full-scale step on every cell of the
           * panel at once, which is worse. Dithering the crossing over several frames spreads it
           * into exactly the high-frequency noise the whole file is built to avoid. What is left is
           * to stop point-sampling: reconstruct each screen row from the TWO character rows it
           * straddles, and CROSSFADE between them across a window HXF of a character row wide
           * centred on the boundary the old code stepped over. The two weights sum to 1 everywhere,
           * so the advert's integrated brightness is unchanged; outside the window one weight is
           * exactly 1 and the cell prints exactly what it printed before; inside it the cell walks
           * from one row's value to the other's instead of jumping.
           *
           * The travel rate is what makes a window that narrow enough: the bob's peak speed in
           * character rows is 0.28*0.33 * NR/H, and NR = round(H/0.30) fixes NR/H at 3.33, so it is
           * 0.31 character rows a second AT ANY DISTANCE — the scale and the depth cancel out of the
           * expression entirely. A smoothstep of width HXF therefore moves a weight by at most
           * 1.5*0.0051/HXF = 0.026 per frame at HXF 0.30, which on the brightest cell the shader can
           * paint is under 3% of full scale.
           *
           * MEASURED ON THE WHOLE ELEMENT, by running tools/flicker-rate.cjs part 2 against this file
           * and against a reconstruction of the point-sampled code it replaced — a reconstruction and
           * not the historical file, which this tree keeps no history of, so it reverts exactly the
           * four things described above and nothing else: point-sampled ri with the clamp, the row
           * loop back inside ya..yb with no margin, the stroke pinned to `y === Math.floor(pT)`, and
           * no lineOnly. Reverting the resample alone still measures 86-98% and reverting the stroke
           * alone 44.7-80.4%, so those are two independent full-scale faults and not one fault seen
           * twice — which is why both halves of this block have to stay.
           * Over the tool's own four seeds and
           * all six skies the worst per-cell frame step goes 45.9-98.0% -> 2.4-3.9%, and the rate
           * that decides the verdict goes 0.100-0.350 big steps a second -> 0.000 in every sky. Both
           * low ends are mist, which damps the panel and everything else; clear is the worst sky and
           * the one to quote, 86.3-98.0% before. There is ONE exception to the after range, it is not
           * this expression's, and it is written out below. Over
           * a 24-seed sweep in clear air (3001 + 137k) it goes min 45.5 / median 89.0 / p90 98.8 /
           * max 100.0% -> min 2.0 / median 3.9 / p90 3.9 / max 4.3%. Part 3's bob-deleted panel
           * reads 2.0-3.1% under the same skies, so the moving panel now sits at the still panel's
           * own floor, which is the definition of the bob no longer popping. The previous revision
           * of this paragraph quoted "2.7-3.9% ... over four seeds and six skies", which is the
           * range with seed 42 left out of it, and 51-98% for the old code where the reconstruction
           * measures 86-98 — quote the outlier or the next reader believes a bound that does not
           * hold.
           *
           * AND THE TRADE WAS CHECKED, because it is the one this fix could plausibly have made and
           * NEITHER number the tool prints can see it: a crossfade that shimmered permanently would

           *
           * THE ONE RESIDUAL, and it belongs to the print floor rather than to the resample: seed 42,
           * yaw 0, t=3.033 s, cell (101,25) at 200x60 steps 42 -> 5 in a single frame, 14.5% of full
           * scale (11.4-14.5% across the five non-mist skies, 3.1% in mist), on 1 seed in the 28
           * measured and at 0.000 big steps a second. Two panels overlap there: a near one at 48 m
           * whose top stroke is crossfading onto an INTERLACED row at ew ~ 0.11, and a far one at
           * 93 m directly behind it. The near stroke's whole value on a lineOnly row is 74*ew*near
           * (band does not multiply a stroke), and the bob walks ew through the `lum < 5` floor
           * further down this loop: at ew 0.1086 that is 8.89, which fogs to 4 and is dropped, and
           * one frame later ew 0.1111 gives 9.09, which fogs to 5 and prints. On the frame it prints
           * it takes the depth slot and hides a 42-lum copy cell of the panel behind.
           * So the panel that MOVED changed by one unit and a different panel lost forty: a hard
           * threshold plus an occlusion, which no amount of resampling touches. The fix for it is to
           * make a hologram composite as light rather than as a surface — never darken a cell it
           * lands on — and that is a change to how this element meets the entire world pass, with a

           * decision instead of being slipped in under a bob fix.

           * edge, which is the same licence the ticker's 2 Hz scroll runs on.
