 * floor, which is nothing more special than terrain of height 0.
 *
 * Camera model is PLANAR, not cylindrical: dir = forward + right*s, left un-normalised, so the
 * march parameter `w` IS the perpendicular (forward-axis) distance and the vertical projection
 * needs no cosine fix-up. Straight building edges stay straight and the frame has no barrel bow.
 * Radial distance — what fog and the elements' depth test want — is w*|dir|, and |dir| is a

    /* Stars are fixed to the world, not to the view; without this they ride the camera round.
     *
     * What Surf.sky is keyed on has to be an ANGLE, and the old `skyOff = (yaw/fov)*cols` added to
     * a raw column index was not one. It is the bearing measured in units of "one column at the
     * CURRENT fov", so the unit itself changed the moment the wheel was touched: zooming did not
     * magnify the star field, it re-dealt it. One 0.045 notch off control.js's zoom re-rolled
     * 291 of 298 lit sky cells at seed 3 with the camera not having moved a millimetre, and
     * skyOff alone slid 12 columns per notch near yaw +-pi/2.
     *
     * So the index is the column's true world BEARING, yaw + atan(sp), on a quantisation pinned to
     * the neutral fov rather than the live one. A first attempt at this used the linear bearing
     * yaw + fov*(x/cols - 0.5), and it was still wrong for the same reason in miniature: the
     * linear form is exact only at the frame edges, and its error in the middle scales with fov,
     * which walked the field about three columns across control.js's 1.02..1.52 range. atan is the
     * exact inverse of the sp the ray was built from, so it removes the dependence outright rather
     * than shrinking it. It costs one atan per COLUMN — not per cell — which is 260 a frame.
     *
     * Math.floor rather than |0 because |0 truncates toward zero, which maps -0.5 and +0.5 onto
     * the same index and prints one duplicated column of sky wherever the bearing crosses zero —
     * and with the bearing now centred on the view axis, that crossing is on screen. */
