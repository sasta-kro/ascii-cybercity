  /* ---- deterministic noise --------------------------------------------
   * Every multiply is Math.imul, and that is not a micro-optimisation — it is correctness.
   * With `*`, `x * 374761393` leaves the 2^53 mantissa the moment |x| passes ~2.4e7 and the
   * low bits, which are the ONLY bits (h >>> 13) and (h >>> 16) go on to mix, are quietly
   * rounded away. The symptom is not noise that looks slightly different; it is per-lot random
   * streams that COLLAPSE — at seed 2e9 the offsets S+601..S+615 used to land in just two
   * distinct streams, and 512 adjacent seeds gave 4 distinct cities. imul keeps the product
   * exact modulo 2^32, which is the arithmetic this hash was designed in.
   *
   * THE FINALIZER IS TWO ROUNDS AND THAT IS ALSO CORRECTNESS, not paranoia. imul(s, 2147483647)
   * is exactly (s << 31) - s, so changing the seed by a small constant changes the mixer's input
   * by that same small constant, and ONE multiply-xorshift round does not hide a small additive
   * offset. Measured over 24 base seeds x 8000 samples (noise floor 0.008): the old single round
   * gave mean |correlation| 0.78 at seed delta 64, 0.64 at 128, 0.48 at 32, and exceeded 0.04 for
   * 80 of the first 160 deltas. That is not an abstract worry, because this file's callers get
   * their "independent" streams by adding a SMALL constant to the seed — S+101, S+211, S+307 and
   * so on — and 389 of the 1026 stream pairs those offsets actually produce measured above 0.05,
   * worst 0.448 (S+211 against S+307). Two supposedly separate ambient systems were drawing the
   * same numbers. With the second round every one of those pairs sits at the noise floor (worst
   * 0.049) and the seed-delta sweep is flat at 0.007-0.011 out to delta 256. The cost is one imul
   * and one xorshift per call, measured at ~5% of hash2's own time, and hash2 is not the render
   * loop's bottleneck. elements/signage.js's hk() — vary the COORDINATE by a large odd offset
   * rather than the seed by a small one — was written to dodge exactly this and is still the
   * belt-and-braces convention, but it is no longer the only thing standing between the build

  /* ---- exposure -------------------------------------------------------
   * The city was a full stop under-exposed: 82-85% of the frame was pure black against a
   * reference that sits at 54-60%, and the lum histogram explained why — 60% of every lit cell
   * landed under 32/255, which is a glyph drawn in a colour nobody can see. The surfaces were
   * not wrong, the print was. So this is a print stage, not a retouch: one curve over the
   * finished frame, applied exactly once, after the world pass and every element.
   *
   * Three things happen per cell, all of them in a lookup table built once at load:
   *
   *   1. a per-swatch EXPOSURE weight. This is the TONAL LADDER and it is the most powerful
   *      control in the file: `gain` multiplies lum before the curve, so gain*255 is the ceiling
   *      a swatch can ever print at, and no amount of light upstream gets a swatch past its own
   *      ceiling. The ladder therefore decides which swatches are allowed to be the brightest
   *      thing on screen. The rule it now encodes: LIGHT OUTRANKS STRUCTURE. The two pillars
   *      (sodium amber, screen azure) must be able to reach the top of the lit range; the three
   *      narrow accents must not out-top the pillars; white and warm are surfaces lit by that
   *      light and sit below it; slate and shadow are unlit concrete and sit below everything.
   *
   *   2. a gamma lift, which is where the stop comes from, with a KNEE that crushes the bottom
   *      instead of lifting it. A plain gamma would drag the 1-10 lum dither out of the dark and
   *      the whole frame would go to grey fog; below the knee the curve bends the other way and
   *      those cells stay black. The knee bites on x = lum*gain/255, so its lum threshold is
   *      GAIN-DEPENDENT — see the KNEE comment below, which used to quote one number as if it
   *      were the same for every swatch.
   *
   *   3. the lift fades out with DEPTH. Distant geometry must fade to BLACK, never to grey, and
   *      Surf.fog earns that in linear light — pushing a fixed x^0.33 over the top of it would
   *      hand the far end of the street its brightness back as haze. Far cells get gamma 1, so
   *      fog's ramp survives untouched and only the near and middle ground open up.
   *
   *   4. a SHOULDER on the highlights, so a swatch can be pushed hard without going flat.
   *
   * Everything upstream keeps reading and writing plain linear lum, which matters: optics.js
   * does read-modify-write gain passes on the frame, and a curve inside put()/poke() would
   * compound through every one of them.
   *
   * These weights are CALIBRATION, not taste: they were fitted by rendering a fixed set of
   * seeds and frames through tools/headless.cjs + tools/topng.py and measuring the printed
   * frame — share of lit energy per swatch, and the proportion of the picture that is pure
   * black. They therefore describe THIS surfaces.js. If the surfaces change what they paint,
   * re-measure and refit; do not adjust them by eye.
   *
   * AND MEASURE THEM OVER A WIDE SAMPLE, because the previous fit was taken over four seeds
   * (3/7/42/99) and this paragraph then asserted, for two rounds, a pillar balance that is true
   * on those four seeds and false everywhere else. The sample below is 32 seeds on a fixed
   * arithmetic rule — 3001 + 137k for k = 0..31 — crossed with frames 600/6000/12000/18000 at
   * 400x100, 128 warm frames rendered through tools/headless.cjs into a fresh directory, plus a
   * 24-seed hold-out on an unrelated rule (9001 + 211k). Four seeds cannot see a distribution and
   * a mean cannot see a spread; quote both or the next reader inherits this same bug.
   *
   * THE LADDER WAS INVERTED AND IT IS THE REASON THE CITY READ AS TEXTURE. The previous table
   * printed, at lum 255 and the near depth bucket: red 243, pure 237, white 228, ice 224, ember
   * 218, warm 204, violet 200, spring 195, azure 156, slate 137, amber 126, shadow 66. Both
   * pillars sat at the BOTTOM of the lit range and structure sat on top of them. Over the
   * canonical 16-frame sweep (seeds 3/7/42/99 x frames 600/3000/9000/18000 at 400x100, through
   * tools/headless.cjs) that produced ZERO amber cells and ZERO azure cells above v=170 in any
   * frame, while white, warm, ember, spring, red and ice all had hot cells. Measured on the near
   * ground (depth 12-25 world units, all 16 frames pooled) white printed 166.5 against azure
   * 105.3 and amber 80.6 — the swatch documented three lines below as "structure, not light" was
   * printing twice as bright as the first pillar on the same depth plane.
   *
   * The claim this paragraph used to make — that the weights "redistribute colour without moving
   * the stop" and that GAMMA and KNEE are the real brightness controls — is false, and it was
   * believed because it was checked against black%, which cannot see it. Swept over the same 16
   * frames: GAMMA 0.33 -> 0.75 moves black 41.30% -> 41.65% while the muddy 9-119 band RISES to
   * 53% and the hot tail COLLAPSES 1.86% -> 0.62%. KNEE 0.055 -> 0.24 drops mid to 37.6% and
   * leaves hot at exactly 1.86% — a knee can delete a shadow, never create a highlight. SHOULDER
   * 0.45 vs 0.90 is a no-op to 0.01 points, because almost nothing except slate ever reached it.
   * EXPOSURE alone, curve untouched, moved mid 51.1% -> 31.5% and hot 1.86% -> 3.29%. black% was
   * blind to all twelve settings because it is pinned by `blank` (glyph 0 or lum 0, which the
   * curve never touches) and `blank` sat at 41.2-41.7% under every one of them.
   *
   * SO THE NUMBERS TO MEASURE ARE NOT black%. They are the share of the frame in the muddy band
   * v=9-119 (28.4%, target under 30%) and the share above v=170 (3.86%, target 3.5-5%). A frame
   * can be 60% black and read beautifully — the strongest composition in the sweep is also one of
   * its blackest — and it can be 40% black and read as flat texture.
   *
   * AND black% NOW MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, which is worth stating because the old "40-55%"
   * band is quoted in briefs as though it still meant one. tools/metrics.py reports `blank` (no
   * glyph, or lum 0 — the curve cannot touch it) at 41.6% and `black(v<9)` (blank PLUS every cell
   * the print takes below visibility) at 56.8%. Those were the same number when KNEE was 0.055
   * and slate's gain was 2.00; raising the knee to 0.075 is what split them, and the 15.2 points
   * between them are the far haze being crushed to black on purpose — the doctrine is that
   * distance fades to BLACK, never to grey. 41.6% sits inside the 40-55% band and 56.8% sits
   * inside the 54-60% this comment's own opening quotes off the reference frames. Neither is out
   * of calibration; they are two censuses of the same picture, and a target has to name which.
   *
   * PILLAR BALANCE — READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING EXPOSURE[0] OR EXPOSURE[1]. Over the 128 frames
   * the pillars take amber 45.3% and azure 35.6% of lit energy, i.e. the pillar pair splits
   * 56.0/44.0. THE PER-FRAME SPREAD IS THE REAL NUMBER AND IT IS ENORMOUS: amber runs 7.8% to
   * 95.0% of lit energy (median 46.0) and azure 3.6% to 75.9% (median 34.1), the per-frame
   * amber:azure ratio runs 0.10 to 26.3 with a median of 1.32, and only 46% of frames have the
   * two within a factor of two of each other. Pooled by seed it is 0.34 to 4.16. A previous
   * revision of this comment reported the pillars "within two points of each other"; that was
   * measured over seeds 3/7/42/99 and is false on every wider sample.
   *
   * THAT SPREAD IS NOT THIS FILE'S TO FIX AND NO SETTING OF THIS TABLE MOVES IT. Measured over
   * the same 128 frames: amber paints 557,598 cells against azure's 387,933, a 1.44:1 COVERAGE
   * ratio, and the correlation between a frame's log cell-count ratio and its log lit-energy
   * ratio is 0.997. The print is already the only thing holding the gap below coverage — amber
   * prints at a mean 131 against azure's 159 on the cells that count as lit. Sweeping every knob
   * in this file over its whole feasible range moves the mean |log2 ratio| only between 1.15 and
   * 1.32, because the gain enters the curve under an exponent of 0.33-1.00: a 2.2x change of
   * EXPOSURE[amber] (0.28 -> 0.62) moves amber's pooled share by 1.25x and nothing else. Which
   * districts a walk passes through is decided in city.js, and how many cells of each swatch a
   * facade paints is decided in surfaces.js (the window-hue roll alone is 42% amber against 30%
   * azure, and SHOP leans a district's shopfronts onto its own pillar). Bending this curve to
   * hide that is exactly how the table came to be overfitted; fix it there or leave it.
   *
   * WHAT THE REFIT DID FIX, all measured on the same 128 frames with only this file swapped:
   *   - the ladder, below, which had five swatches printing above the first pillar;
   *   - white's max share of a frame's lit energy 36.6% -> 32.4% and its ceiling 174 -> 151, so
   *     the white wall that was the brightest object in s4645_f18000 is grey structure again;
   *   - warm outranking a pillar 22/128 frames -> 17/128, pooled 11.1% -> 9.3%;
   *   - frames led by something that is neither pillar 6/128 -> 3/128;
   *   - ember's max share 33.8% -> 29.1% and its ceiling 203 -> 163, which is the print-side half
   *     of the accent-leads-the-frame bug city.js measured and could not bound from its side;
   *   - the pillar split 57.4/42.6 -> 56.0/44.0 and the median ratio 1.39 -> 1.32. That is the
   *     whole of what the centre had left in it at no cost to the ladder, and it is small.
   * Costs: hot 3.73% -> 3.86% (in band), muddy 28.8% -> 28.4%, black and blank unmoved.
   *
   * EXPOSURE IS NOT PRIVATE TO THIS FILE, so a refit is not a print-only change however much this
   * comment would like it to be: elements/optics.js's `mistfar` reads CC.EXPOSURE to rescale a
   * warm cell's lum when it repaints it to slate, on purpose, so that the hue swap costs the frame
   * no printed energy. Refitting therefore moves what that element writes, which moves the frame
   * an element measures, which moves the next tick — an offline table sweep is not exactly the
   * shipped walk. Measured, over the 32 most mist-loaded frames of the sweep (mistfar does nothing
   * in the other five skies): 0.53% of cells move before the print and every reported statistic
   * moves by at most 0.03 of a point, slate's own share being the largest. Small, but it is the
   * reason a refit has to be confirmed by re-rendering and not only by re-printing.
   *
   * A LEVER THAT WOULD DO MORE AND IS DELIBERATELY NOT SHIPPED. Amber's share and amber's ceiling
   * are the same knob here, so the two things wrong with amber pull opposite ways: amber-dominant
   * frames are also the COLDEST frames (the 12 frames with the least hot tail average 53.2% amber
   * and 0.87% hot against the 3.5-5 target, because amber's ceiling barely clears the hot line),
   * yet raising amber's gain to fix that raises its share too. Giving KNEE a per-swatch entry
   * separates them: amber at gain 0.72 with its own knee at 0.26 holds the share at 43.8% while
   * the hot tail goes 3.73% -> 6.91% and amber-frame hot 2.40% -> 7.03%. It was measured, it
   * works, and it is a new mechanism rather than a recalibration of an existing one, so it is
   * recorded here for whoever owns that decision instead of being slipped in under a refit. */
  /* THE LADDER. Printed ceilings under this table (lum 255, near bucket, scaled by the swatch's
   * own pigment): pure 234, azure 220, red 206, amber 180, ice 175, warm 167, ember 163, spring
   * 163, violet 154, white 151, slate 114, shadow 60.
   *
   * THE RULE, which the previous table stated and then broke in five places (ember 203, ice 209,
   * warm 195, violet 179 and red 214 all sat above the first pillar's 177): only `pure` and `red`
   * — a specular return and an actual lamp — may print above a pillar, and neither may print
   * above the HIGHER pillar. Every accent, and every surface that is merely lit by the pillars,
   * sits under the LOWER one. Read it as four tiers: specular and lamps; the two pillars; the
   * narrow accents and the lit surfaces beneath them; unlit concrete at the bottom.
   *
   * The 40-point gap between the two pillars is not sloppiness, it is the correction: amber
   * paints 1.44 cells for every azure cell (see PILLAR BALANCE above), so the more numerous
   * pigment gets the lower ceiling and the two arrive at comparable presence. Both still clear
   * the v=170 hot line, which is what "the pillars own the top of the lit range" has to mean. */

            //              pillar split 56.6/43.4 -> 56.0/44.0. Past here the return collapses
            //              (the cells are over the SHOULDER) and the frames that are already
            //              azure-led start to glare — at 1.10 the hottest frame in the sweep goes
            //              to 18.8% of cells above v=170 and the near screens read as a flat wall
            //              of blue rather than as windows
    0.42,   //  2 ember   — NARROW accent, ceiling 163, under the lower pillar. It was 0.80 for a
            //              ceiling of 203, ABOVE the first pillar's 177, and that is the print
            //              side of the bug city.js measured from the other end: in the near depth
            //              bucket ember printed a median 175.7 against amber's 139.2 in the SAME
            //              frame, so a small ember district on the near wall became the subject
            //              of the picture. Six district-table levers were swept in city.js and
            //              none of them bounded it, because dimming a slab that already fills the
            //              frame moves numerator and denominator together; the ceiling does bound
            //              it, and only in the frames that were failing
    0.60,   //  3 spring  — narrow accent, ceiling 163. It was once the highest weight in the whole
            //              table at 1.55, applied to the rarest accent, and wherever a spring
            //              district came into view it detonated. THE RULE: no accent's ceiling
            //              may exceed the LOWER pillar's, or the accent becomes the focal point
            //              of every frame its district appears in. Spring still reaches 24.4% of
            //              a frame's lit energy at its worst, which is coverage and belongs to
            //              whichever element paints that mass, not to this table
    0.34,   //  4 violet  — narrow accent, ceiling 154, and the one that goes gaudy the instant it
            //              is indulged: at the old 0.50 it printed 179, over the first pillar,
            //              and s5467_f6000 carries a violet slab across the top-left corner
            //              holding 24.9% of the frame's lit energy. The ceiling stops it leading;
            //              the slab itself is a paint fact
    0.30,   //  5 white   — structure, not light, and finally printed like it: ceiling 151, well
            //              under both pillars. At 1.15 it printed 228 and was the brightest broad
            //              swatch in the frame; at 0.44 it still printed 174, one point under the
            //              first pillar, and in s4645_f18000 a white wall was the brightest object
            //              on screen with 36.6% of the frame's lit energy. Specular hits belong to
            //              `pure`; white is the thing the light lands on. Worst-frame share is now
            //              32.4% and white leads no frame in the sweep
    0.56,   //  6 red     — aerial lamps read at their own brightness or they are not lamps, so red
            //              is allowed above the pillars — but not above the HIGHER one, which 0.62
            //              was (214 against azure's 211). At 206 it still tops amber, which is the
            //              point of a lamp, and cannot top a wall of screens. At 1.05 it printed
            //              243 and the single brightest object in the entire reference sweep was
            //              not a lamp at all but a red facade wall
    0.60,   //  7 slate   — unlit concrete. It was at 2.00 "for coverage", and 2.00 is past the
            //              SHOULDER, which silently cancelled its depth fade: slate printed 137.5
            //              at the near plane and 136.9 at the fog wall, a 0.4% fade, on 36% of
            //              every painted cell. That is why the canyon did not read — the
            //              geometry was there, the luminance gradient that lets an eye see it was
            //              not. INVARIANT: a swatch that is coverage rather than light must keep
            //              gain*lum under SHOULDER across the lums it actually gets written at,
            //              or it loses the one cue that makes far things far. At 2.00 slate was
            //              over it from lum 79 up, which is most of a facade. Coverage itself is
            //              untouched, because coverage is which cells surfaces.js paints and not
            //              how bright they print: `blank` moved 43.3% -> 42.3% over the sweep, so
            //              the facades are still slabs and not lattices
    0.32,   //  8 warm    — interior spill. At 30-38% it was a third pillar, and a yellow one; at
            //              0.48 it was still printing 195, above the first pillar's 177, and it
            //              outranked a pillar outright in 22 of 128 frames while reading to the
            //              eye as more amber. Ceiling 167 and 17 of 128, which is as far as a
            //              ceiling can take it: the frames where warm leads are frames standing
            //              in front of a lit interior, and that is surfaces.js's massing, not a
            //              print fault
    0.36,   //  9 ice     — rain highlight; belongs with azure. A GLINT, never a surface, and the
            //              old ceiling of 208 made it a surface: it sat above BOTH the first
            //              pillar and every accent on the strength of being rare, which is the
            //              same argument that put spring at 1.55. Rarity bounds how many cells a
            //              swatch owns, never how bright the frame's brightest thing is. At 175 it
            //              is still the top of the accent tier, still reads as a glint against wet
            //              road, and takes at most 2.7% of a frame's lit energy
    0.85,   // 10 pure    — specular only; it is already at the top of the scale
    0.80    // 11 shadow  — occluded structure must READ as occluded structure, not as a hole, and
            //              this one is deliberately NOT 0.60. shadow's pigment tops out at 66, so
            //              unlike slate it was never in the inverted ladder and could not compete
            //              with a pillar at any gain; its only real fault at 2.60 was the same
            //              fade cancellation, since from lum 61 up it sat past the SHOULDER, and
            //              it is 24% of every painted cell. At 0.60 the near facades that are in
            //              shadow stop being mass and become holes — the whole left half of
            //              s42_f18000 goes to flat black. 0.80 keeps them as dark blue-grey
            //              slabs (a typical shadow cell prints v 26-36 instead of 21) with the
            //              fade intact, since its working lum range 20-60 is nowhere near the
            //              shoulder, and the 16-frame muddy band still comes in under target at
            //              28.6%. THE INVARIANT is not "gain below SHOULDER" but "the swatch's
            //              WORKING lum range times its gain stays below SHOULDER" — that is what
            //              2.00 and 2.60 broke, from lum 79 and 61 up respectively
