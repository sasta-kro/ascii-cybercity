/* CyberCity weather director — the one place that decides what the sky is doing.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT FOUR CONSTANTS IN weather.js.
 * Rain, fog, steam, lightning, the wetness of the road, the haze on the far end of the street, the
 * stars in the slot between the rooftops and whether a pedestrian is carrying an umbrella are all
 * the SAME FACT seen from eight different files. Left to themselves each of those files picks its
 * own constant and the city ends up with heavy rain falling through a clear starfield onto a dry
 * road — which is precisely what it did before this file existed. So the fact lives here once and
 * everything else reads it.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. `state(t)` is a pure function of (seed, t): a seeded sequence of segments indexed by
 * segment number, exactly the way city.js indexes its route by arc length. Scrubbing to frame 9000
 * offline gives the weather the browser has at frame 9000, which is the whole reason the headless
 * harness is worth anything. The ONLY impurity is a deliberate one — `set()` and `cycle()`, which a
 * viewer reaches through the keyboard — and it is stamped with the time it happened so the blend
 * out of it is still a function of t.
 *
 * READING IT. Every parameter is 0..1 and every one of them is a DIRECTION, not a multiplier for
 * any particular element's constants. An element that was already tuned reads `rel(name)`, which is
 * that parameter divided by its value in the `rain` preset — the preset the whole build was tuned
 * under before this file landed — so `rel` returns 1.0 for the look that already shipped and the
 * element scales around it. That is the migration rule and it is not optional: an element that
 * multiplies by the raw parameter silently re-tunes itself to 65% of what it was.

   * eye. Pinning each preset from t=0 and rendering seeds 3/7/42/99 at frame 1800, 400x100, the
   * share of cells whose printed luminance differs by more than 10% of full scale is: clear vs
   * drizzle 5.2%, downpour vs storm 7.3%, against mist vs anything at 17-21%. The per-frame
   * particle noise floor is about 3%, so downpour and storm are very nearly the same picture and
   * only the lightning rate tells them apart. Lit coverage over the four seeds says the same
   * thing: clear 24.0%, drizzle 24.3%, rain 25.9%, downpour 26.2%, mist 22.1%, storm 26.3%.
   *
   * THE FIX IS NOT IN THIS TABLE, and that was measured rather than assumed. Widening the gap
   * here — downpour wind 0.85 -> 0.55, fog 0.36 -> 0.42, and storm fog 0.44 -> 0.24, haze 0.60
   * -> 0.38, so that the two presets disagree on wind by 45 points instead of 15 — moved the
   * rendered difference from 7.3% of cells to 8.5%. That is the elements spending the whole wind
   * and fog budget on things the print cannot see; until weather.js turns wind into continuously
   * visible travelling structure, a bigger number here only changes what downpour looks like
   * without making storm look like anything else. Widen it in the same change that gives the
   * elements something to do with it, and re-run the pinned comparison above. */
